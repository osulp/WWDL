		<![CDATA[<p>This page allows the Administrator (and possibly Archive Manager) to view information about the last harvest and the number of records indexed, and additionally to flush and re-harvest records in this archive.</p><p>It is recommended that large archives be harvested using the command-line tool (tools/harvest.php), as browsers will often time-out while waiting for a harvest to complete.</p>]]>
