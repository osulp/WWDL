	<h4><a href="http://evols.library.manoa.hawaii.edu/handle/10524/11857" target="_blank">Hawaiian Waters</a></h4>
	<p> The goal of the project   is to identify, digitize, and enhance access to monographs and reports   about water, focusing on publications of the governments of the Hawaiian   kingdom (though 1893), republic  (1894-1898), as well as the state and counties of Hawaii. These   materials will illustrate the competing interests of Native Hawaiians   who view water as a gift from  the gods that require conservation and preservation by all, and western   institutions and businesses that transformed the physical landscape and   claimed private ownership over water in  Hawaii. Making these formerly scattered and difficult to locate reports   more easily available will enhance historical, pollical and cultural   research.	  </p>
	
	<h4><a href="http://scholarspace.manoa.hawaii.edu/handle/10125/1678">Water Resources Research Center &amp; Environmental Center</a></h4>
	<p>Hawaii's culture and climate present unique issues and problems of water   resource management. Rainfall events in the islands are often intense   and short compared to most temperate climates. Hawaiian hydrogeology   differs markedly from most other areas. We are almost entirely dependent   on groundwater for our drinking water. The islands are closed systems,   importing water is not feasible if we overuse or contaminate our   aquifers. Our tropical climate permits the usual pollution indicator   organisms to grow in the soil, compromising their usefulness for   detecting pollution. Our tourism-based economy is dependent upon   vigilant stewardship of our nearshore water quality. As a key element of   traditional Hawaiian life, water, both fresh and ocean, plays a unique   and important cultural role. At WRRC we concentrate on addressing the   unique water and wastewater management problems and issues that we in   the Pacific face. </p>

	<h4><a href="http://westernwaters.org/misearch/results?query=+galveston+hurricane&amp;crosswalk-5=" target="_blank">Galveston 1915 Hurricane Photographs</a></h4>
<p>These 124 photographs capture the devastation wrought by the hurricane that hit Galveston Island on August 17, 1915. The collection features black-and-white and sepia-toned images of destroyed buildings, streets, railroads, causeway, and beachfront, taken by Rex Dunbar Frazier in the immediate aftermath of the storm.</p>

<p>Frazier, a representative of Stone & Webster Engineering, was called in to collect storm damage data and document the scene. Most of the photographs date from August 18, 1915, although many are undated. Some later photographs show repairs underway a month or two later. The photos were removed from a scrapbook for preservation purposes, but the text from the original captions has been retained. </p>

<p>The Galveston Hurricane of 1900 is well known for having killed over 10,000 people on the island, but less well known is the fact that in 1915, Galveston was again hit by a devastating hurricane. This one caused $50 million worth of property damage, yet resulted in only 275 deaths. The low loss of life has been attributed to the protection offered by the seawall, which was constructed following the 1900 hurricane. </p>

<p>Some information for this description was drawn from the <a href="http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online">Handbook of Texas Online</a>.

  <h4><a href="http://digital.library.unlv.edu/collections/historic-landscape">The Historic Landscape of Nevada</a></h4>
	<p>The Historic Landscape of Nevada: Development, Water and the Natural Environment documents the historic role of water resource management in Southern Nevada. Since the nineteenth century, when the U.S. government first sent   scientific expeditions to explore, map, and record the West, a   voluminous record has been made of this landscape and the potential to   exploit (and sometimes protect) it. Whether through irrigation,   ranching, agriculture, dams, railroads, highways, towns, cities, or   federal installations, the people of Nevada have challenged the   environment in their attempt to make a desert flourish.</p>

	<h4><a href="http://digital.library.unlv.edu/collections/hoover-dam">Hoover Dam Collection</a></h4>
	<p>
	The Hoover Dam Collection is comprised of photographs and documentary videos about the construction of Hoover Dam in the early 1930s.  The photos include Franklin Roosevelt’s visit and documentation of the living environment of the workers. Also included are the Bureau of Reclamation’s documentary, “Conquering the Colorado “, and recorded interviews by Dennis McBride documenting workers’ experiences during the construction of the dam. </p>

	<h4><a href="http://digital.library.unlv.edu/collections/water" target="_blank">Las Vegas: Water in the West</a></h4>
	<p>
	The collection documents the history of water and Las Vegas. It includes U.S. military and scientific surveys conducted to map a route for the transcontinental railroad, records which explore the feasibility of irrigating the desert for agriculture, as well as records regarding the planning and construction of the Hoover Dam.</p>

	<h4><a href="http://digital.library.unlv.edu/collections/maps" target="_blank">
	Southern Nevada and Las Vegas History in Maps</a></h4>
	<p>
	The maps selected for this digital project document the cartographic history and context of this region. Examples of water-related maps include: the municipal water system of Las Vegas, the Boulder Canyon project, surveys of John Fremont, and the Southern Nevada Water Project.</p>

	<h4><a href="http://westernwaters.org/index.php/browse/index/26" target="_blank">UNLV Digital Commons Water Resources</a></h4>
	<p>One of the objectives of the digital project was to provide a digital  repository for published technical and scientific reports related to geology,  water supply, and water quality in the Las Vegas Valley. Although the  collection of reports is not comprehensive, it does make available online as  many of the most critical studies related to water in Southern Nevada. We hope  to continue adding to this digital repository, which is maintained in the <a href="http://digitalcommons.library.unlv.edu/">Library’s Digital Commons</a>. </p>
	<p>
	  These publications include ground-water resource and supply bulletins and  papers published by the USGS, the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, The Nevada State  Engineer and the Nevada Department of Conservation and Natural Resources;  reports sponsored by the Southern Nevada Water Authority and the Clark County  Sanitation District; and scientific studies conducted and published by the UNLV  Lake Mead Limnological Research Center and the University of Nevada Desert  Research Institute. There are also socioeconomic and biological impact studies  conducted for the Bureau of Reclamation on the Southern Nevada Water Project.		</p>

	KUER reporters set to find out whether Utah truly needs the Bear River Dam, or whether conservation could be the answer. What they found was another story entirely&#8230;the story of a water system bloated with inefficiency and water, that unnecessarily cost taxpayers millions of dollars and forces them to pay for the water use of everyone else on the system. This video collection is a story that you will hear in a three-part series. </p>

	<h4><a href="http://content.lib.utah.edu/cdm/search/collection/wwdl-av">Water is for Fightin&#8217;</a></h4>
	<p>In Utah and other parts of the West, life revolves around water. Land use decisions, land development, law politics, and economic growth have all been shaped by water or the lack thereof. As demand for land and water increases, Westerners must not only be able to determine and protect rights to water, but also preserve the sanctity of their rivers, lakes, and streams. </p>
