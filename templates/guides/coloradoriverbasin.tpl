<h3>Searching the WWDL for Colorado River Basin Materials</h3>
<p>If you need to find information on a particular topic, you can limit your results by  searching for the date, location, topic, and the phrase &quot;Colorado River&quot; in the subject area of the <a href="/misearch">Western Waters Advanced search page</a>. </p>
<p>Many of the digital collections in the Western Waters Digital Library use Library of Congress subject headings to describe their items, so using subject headings in the subject area of the advanced search page can allow you to find materials on very specific topics, such as:</p>
<p><a href="/misearch/results?query=&amp;archiveIds[]=all&amp;isAdvanced=1&amp;crosswalk-2=Water Resources Development - Colorado&amp;searchPage=1">Water Resources Development - Colorado</a><br />
<a href="/misearch/results?query=&amp;archiveIds[]=all&amp;isAdvanced=1&amp;crosswalk-2=Colorado River Commission&amp;searchPage=1">Colorado River Commission </a><br />
<a href="/misearch/results?query=&amp;archiveIds[]=all&amp;isAdvanced=1&amp;crosswalk-2=Central Arizona Project&amp;searchPage=1">Central Arizona Project</a><br />

<p>You can also search for phrases that apply to your research by putting them in quotes, for example: &quot;water quality&quot; and &quot;colorado river&quot;. If you are only looking for reports as opposed to images, try limiting your search to &quot;text.&quot;</p>
