<a href="/contact">University of Utah IT department.</a></p>
	
	
	<h4>2. What kind of information can I find on the WWDL?</h4>
  <p>
	The currently available resources include classic water literature, government reports, legal transcripts, water project records, 
	personal papers, theses and dissertations, white papers, and photographic collections. </p>
	
	
	<h4>3. The items that I am interested in are not available online. Why aren't all of the items digitized? </h4>
	<p>
	Unfortunately, not all of the contents in all of the collections have been digitized.  
	Each institution makes a decision to digitize all or portions of a collection based on funding, resources, copyright considerations, and  
	research value. </p>
	
	
	<h4>4. What are the copyright issues related to the items on the WWDL?</h4>
	<p>The materials in the WWDL are intended to be used for research, teaching, and private study.  
	All items may be protected by the U.S. Copyright Law (Title 17, U.S.C.). Usage of some items may  
	also be subject to additional restrictions imposed by the copyright owner and/or the institution. Please contact  
	the individual institution for specific details. </p>
