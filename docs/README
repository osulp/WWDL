About
-----
The PKP Harvester has been developed by the Public Knowledge Project.
For general information about the Harvester and other open research systems,
visit the PKP web site at <http://pkp.sfu.ca/>.


License
-------
The PKP Harvester is licensed under the GNU General Public License v2. See the
file docs/COPYING for the complete terms of this license.

Third parties are welcome to modify and redistribute the Harvester in entirety
or parts according to the terms of this license. PKP also welcomes patches for
improvements or bug fixes to the software.


System Requirements
-------------------
Recommended server requirements:

	* PHP >= 4.2.x (including PHP 5.x); Microsoft IIS requires PHP 5.x
	* MySQL >= 3.23.23 (including MySQL 4.x/5.x) or PostgreSQL >= 7.1
	  (including PostgreSQL 8.x)
	* Apache >= 1.3.2x or >= 2.0.4x or Microsoft IIS 6 (untested)
	* Operating system: Any OS that supports the above software, including
	  Linux, BSD, Solaris, Mac OS X, Windows

As PKP does not have the resources to test every possible combination of
software versions and platforms, no guarantee of correct operation or support
is implied. We welcome feedback from users who have deployed the Harvester on
systems other than those listed above.


Recommended Configuration
-------------------------

A secure deployment can be best achieved by using the following policies:

	* Dedicate a database to the Harvester; use unique credentials to access
	  it. Configure this database to perform automated backups on a regular
	  basis. Perform a manual backup when upgrading or performing
	  maintenance.

	* Configure the Harvester (config.inc.php) to use SHA1 hashing rather
	  than MD5.

	* Configure the Harvester (config.inc.php) to use force_ssl_login so
	  that authenticated users communicate with the server via HTTPS.


Installation
------------
Please review this document and the RELEASE document prior to installing the
Harvester. If you encounter problems, please also see the FAQ document in this
directory.

To install the Harvester:

	1. Extract the Harvester archive to the desired location in your web
	   documents directory.
	
	2. Make the following files and directories (and their contents)
	   writeable (i.e., by changing the owner or permissions with chown or
	   chmod):
	   
	     * config.inc.php (optional -- if not writable you will be prompted
	       to manually overwrite this file during installation)
	     * public
	     * cache
	     * cache/t_cache
	     * cache/t_config
	     * cache/t_compile
	     * cache/_db
	
	3. Open a web browser to <http://yourdomain.com/path/to/harvester2/> and
	   follow the on-screen installation instructions.
	   
	   Alternatively, the command-line installer can be used instead by
	   running the command "php tools/install.php" from your Harvester
	   directory. (Note: with the CLI installer you may need to chown/chmod
	   the public and uploaded files directories after installation, if the
	   Apache user is different from the user running the tool.)
	 
	4. Recommended additional steps post-installation:
	
	     * Review config.inc.php for additional configuration settings
	     * Review the FAQ document for frequently asked technical and
	       server configuration questions.


Upgrading
---------
See docs/UPGRADE for information on upgrading from previous OJS 1.x and OJS 2.x
releases.


Localization
------------
To add support for other languages, the following sets of XML files must be
localized and placed in an appropriately named directory (using ISO locale 
codes, e.g. "fr_FR", is recommended):

	* locale/en_US
	* lib/pkp/locale/en_US
	* dbscripts/xml/data/locale/en_US
	* help/en_US
	* rt/en_US
	* plugins/[plugin category]/[plugin name]/locale, where applicable

The only critical files that need translation for the system to function
properly are locale/en_US and dbscripts/xml/data/locale/en_US.

New locales must also be added to the file registry/locales.xml, after which
they can be installed in the system through the site administration web
interface.
	
Translations can be contributed back to PKP for distribution with future
releases of the Harvester.

Server requirements for full Unicode (UTF-8) support:

	* MySQL >= 4.1.1 or PostgreSQL >= 7.1
	* PHP >= 4.3.0 compiled with support for the mbstring library


Third-party Libraries
---------------------
	* See lib/pkp/lib/libraries.txt for a list of third-party libraries used
	  by the PKP Harvester.
