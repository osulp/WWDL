Harvester2 2.3.0 Release Notes
CVS tag: harvester-2_3_0-0
Release date: Feb 18, 2009
=================================

Configuration Changes
---------------------

See config.TEMPLATE.inc.php for a description and examples of all supported
configuration parameters.

New config.inc.php parameters:
	- general.restful_urls: Whether or not the Harvester should use RESTful
	    URLs (i.e. omitting the index.php part of the script with the aid of
	    Apache mod_rewrite, as documented in README)
	- general.throttling_delay: Support throttling to limit data source load
	- i18n.charset_normalization: Enable or disable detection and correction
	    of UTF8 errors and invalid sequences
	- email.require_validation: Enable or disable validation of email
	    addresses for self-registered accounts
	- oai.oai: Enable or disable OAI data provider support
	- oai.repository_id: OAI Repository ID for OAI data provider support
	- captcha.captcha_on_register: Enable CAPTCHA testing for user
	    registrations


New Features
------------
Harvester 2.3 represents a major rewrite of large portions of the software from
prior releases, including rewritten storage and indexing code, support for more
user accounts and user self-registration, plugin-based indexing including SOLR/
Lucene support (in addition to the traditional MySQL-based inverted index), and
much more.

NOTE: Upgrading from prior releases will retain settings and the archive list,
but harvested metadata WILL NOT be migrated to the new version and old entries
will be DELETED. After upgrading, all data sources must be re-indexed.
