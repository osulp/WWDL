===================================
Server Configuration and Management
===================================

   1) Will Open Harvester Systems work with PHP as a CGI instead of as an Apache
      module?

A: Open Harvester Systems is known to work reasonably well with PHP as a CGI
   using Apache's mod_actions. Since there are a number of different ways to
   configure Apache to use the CGI version of PHP (e.g., through FastCGI, etc.),
   your mileage may vary with other deployments (feedback is welcomed).

   On PHP 4 it may be necessary to add "cgi.fix_pathinfo = 1" to the server's
   php.ini to avoid fatal "No input file specified" errors. This parameter is
   enabled by default on PHP 5.
   
   Open Harvester Systems may not function correctly if the base directory is
   located outside of the virtual host's DocumentRoot directory (e.g., when
   using mod_alias or mod_userdir). This is due to a bug/feature in the method
   PHP uses to determine the SCRIPT_NAME environment variable by stripping the
   DOCUMENT_ROOT from SCRIPT_FILENAME.

   -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

   2) Will Open Harvester Systems work correctly in PHP's "safe mode"?

A: Open Harvester Systems is known to work reasonably well with PHP's safe mode
   restrictions (including open_basedir) enabled. Testing has not been
   extensive, so there may be unknown issues, in particular with very
   restrictive configurations that disable PHP functions relied on by Open
   Harvester Systems (feedback is welcomed).

   -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

   3) Will Open Harvester Systems work in a Microsoft IIS environment, or on
      other non-Apache web servers?

A: While Harvester 2.x has not been tested on Microsoft IIS servers, it is based
   on the Open Journal Systems 2.x codebase, which has been tested on Microsoft
   Windows Server 2003 with IIS 6.0 on PHP 5.x. Additional standard environments
   should also be supported; we welcome feedback from users who have
   successfully installed and used Open Harvester Systems in other server
   environments.

   -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

   4) How can I create a backup of an Open Harvester Systems installation?

A: It is recommended that Open Harvester Systems be periodically backed up to
   guard against a failure in Open Harvester Systems or the server software or
   hardware that could result in data loss.
   
   To properly backup an Open Harvester Systems installation, the following
   should be backed up:
     - The database, using the tools provided by your DBMS (e.g.,
       mysqldump for MySQL, pg_dump for PostgreSQL)
     - The base Open Harvester Systems directory
       
   This backup procedure can be easily integrated into any automated backup
   mechanism.

   -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

   5) How can I move an existing Open Harvester Systems installation to a
      different server?

A: To move an Open Harvester Systems installation from one server to another,
   you will need to:

   - Copy the database data, and import it into the new server (e.g., using the
     command-line tools provided by the DBMS)
   - Copy the base Open Harvester Systems directory and non-public files
     directory
   - Update config.inc.php with any changed settings for the new server
     (typically, the base URL, database authentication/access, email, and files
     settings will differ between servers)



=======================
Common Technical Issues
=======================

   1) When I try to access my Open Harvester Systems site this error message is
      displayed:
      "Warning: Smarty error: problem creating directory './templates' in
      ./lib/smarty/Smarty.class.php"

A: This can occur if a higher level directory has execute permission but not
   read permission. In these situations, the __FILE__ value in an included file
   appears to be relative to the location of the including file. This issue can
   be resolved by ensuring all parent directories are both readable and
   executable.

   See also this PHP bug report: <http://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=16231>.

   -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

   3) Emails sent out by the system are never received.

A: By default, Open Harvester Systems sends mail through PHP's built-in mail()
   facility.

   On Windows PHP needs to be configured to send email through a SMTP server
   (running either on the same machine or on another machine).
   
   On other platforms such as Linux and Mac OS X, PHP will sent mail using the
   local sendmail client, so a local MTA such as Sendmail or Postfix must be
   running and configured to allow outgoing mail.
   
   See <http://www.php.net/mail> for more details on configuring PHP's mail
   functionality.
   
   Open Harvester Systems can also be configured to use an SMTP server as
   specified in config.inc.php, either with or without authentication.

   -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

   4) I am using Apache 2.0.x, and Open Harvester Systems pages fail to load,
      producing an error like "File does not exist: .../index.php/index/...".

A: With some versions or configurations of Apache 2.0.x, it may be necessarily
   to explicitly enable the AcceptPathInfo directive in your Apache
   configuration file.
   
   See http://httpd.apache.org/docs-2.0/mod/core.html for more information about
   this directive.

   -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

   5) Open Harvester Systems installation fails with the MySQL error "Client
      does not support authentication protocol requested by server; consider
      upgrading MySQL client".

A: This problem is caused by a change in the MySQL authentication protocol in
   MySQL 4.1, and can occur if your system is using an older MySQL client
   library with a newer MySQL server.

   See http://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql/en/Old_client.html for suggested
   approaches to resolve this issue.

   -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

   6) "Warning: ini_set(): A session is active. You cannot change the session
       module's ini settings at this time" messages appear when I load
       Open Harvester Systems.

A: Check if session.auto_start is enabled in your php.ini configuration.
   Open Harvester Systems requires this setting to be disabled, which is the
   default behaviour in current versions of PHP.

   -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

   7) The installation form loads successfully, but after clicking the button
       to install, a blank page appears and the database was not created.

A: This may indicate that your server does not have the selected PHP database
   module installed and enabled (this can be verified by looking at the output
   of phpinfo() to see if the required database support exists -- see
   http://php.net/phpinfo).
   
   The Open Harvester Systems installer lists database drivers for which the
   required PHP extension does not appear to be loaded in brackets (e.g.,
   "[MySQL]").
   
   Most Linux distributions offer a separate package that can be installed for
   each supported PHP database module -- e.g., php4-mysql or php-mysql (for
   MySQL support), or php4-pgsql or php-pgsql (for PostgreSQL support).
   
   Note also that even with the module installed it may be necessary to modify
   your php.ini configuration to load the module, by adding "extension=mysql.so"
   or "extension=pgsql.so", for example.

   -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

   8) How can I remove "index.php" from the URLs in Open Harvester Systems?

A: Open Harvester Systems uses a REST-style URL syntax for all of its links. To
   force Open Harvester Systems to remove the "index.php" portion of all URLs,
   edit config.inc.php and set "restful_urls" to "On".
   
   In addition, your server will have to support URL rewriting in order to
   recognize the new URLs.  Apache servers use the mod_rewrite plugin, which
   must be enabled in your httpd.conf, and the following section added to the
   correct section of either your httpd.conf or an .htaccess file (preferred) in
   your Open Harvester Systems root directory (the same location as
   config.inc.php):
   
   <IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
   RewriteEngine on
   RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
   RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
   RewriteRule ^(.*)$ index.php/$1 [QSA,L]
  </IfModule>
