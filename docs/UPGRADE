Upgrading a Harvester Installation
-----------------------------------

Note: backing up your current data files and database is strongly recommended
prior to upgrading the Harvester.

If you are using PHP Safe Mode, please ensure that the max_execution_time
directive in your php.ini configuration file is set to a high limit. If this
or any other time limit (e.g. Apache's "Timeout" directive) is reached and
the upgrade process is interrupted, manual intervention will be required.


============================
Upgrading from Harvester 2.x
============================

WARNING: Harvester release 2.3 contains a rewrite of the metadata storage code
used in prior releases. Upgrading will maintain settings and the list of
archives but will DELETE all metadata stored in the system. After upgrading,
perform a harvest of all archives to re-index and store the data in the new
structure.

Upgrading to the latest version of the Harvester involves two steps:

    - Obtaining the latest Harvester code
    - Upgrading the Harvester database

It is highly recommended that you also review the release notes (docs/RELEASE)
and other documentation in the docs directory before performing an upgrade.

Obtaining the latest Harvester code
------------------------------------

The Harvester source code is available in three forms: as patches against older
releases of the Harvester, from read-only github access, and as a complete
stand-alone package.

Patching or updating from github is the recommended approach if you have made
local modifications to the system.

1. Patch

Patch files for older releases of the Harvester can be downloaded from the
Harvester web site.

To update by patching, download the appropriate patch file for your current
version of the Harvester and run the following command from your Harvester
directory:

    $ patch -p1 < PATCH_FILE

"PATCH_FILE" should be replaced with the path to the decompressed patch file
that was downloaded, e.g. "harvester-2.0_to_2.0.1.patch".

Alternatively, Harvester 2.0.1 and later provide a command-line tool to
automatically download and apply the appropriate patch to upgrade to the latest
release. To use this tool run the following command from your Harvester
directory:

    $ php tools/upgrade.php patch

Note that this will require the GNU patch tool to be installed. GNU patch is
included in most *NIX distributions, and is available for Windows and Solaris
as a download. Windows users may need to work around a patch bug by converting
the line-endings in the patch file from UNIX to DOS; to do this, open the patch
file in Notepad and save it again.

Patch upgrades will NOT include any binary files that were introduced in the
new version, i.e. any GIF images that are needed in the new version but were
not included in the old version. To find a list of binaries that should be
manually added after applying the patch, search the patch file for lines like:
"Binary files (filename here) differ" (not including the quotes). These files
can be found in the distribution archive.


2. git

If your instance of the Harvester was checked out from github (see docs/README-GIT),
you can update the Harvester code using a git client.

To update the Harvester code from a git clone, run the following command
from your Harvester directory:

    $ git rebase --onto <new-release-tag> <previous-release-tag>

This assumes that you have made local changes and committed them on top of
the old release tag. The command will take your custom changes and apply
them on top of the new release. This may cause merge conflicts which have to
be resolved in the usual way, e.g. using a merge tool like kdiff3.

"TAG" should be replaced with the git tag corresponding to the new release.
Harvester release version tags are of the form
"harvester-MAJOR_MINOR_REVSION-BUILD". For example, the tag for the initial
release of Harvester 2.0.1 is "harvester-2_0_1-0".

Consult the README of the latest Harvester package or the Harvester web site
for the tag corresponding to the latest available Harvester release.

Note that attempting to update to an unreleased version (e.g., using the HEAD
tag to obtain the bleeding-edge Harvester code) is not recommended for anyone
other than Harvester or third-party developers; using experimental code on a
production deployment is strongly discouraged and will not be supported in any
way by the Harvester team.


3. Full Package

It is also possible to upgrade by downloading the complete package for the
latest release of the Harvester:

    - Download and decompress the package from the Harvester web site
    - Make a copy of the config.inc.php provided in the new package
    - Move or copy the following files and directories from your current
      Harvester installation:
        - config.inc.php
        - public/
    - Replace the current Harvester directory with the new Harvester
      directory, moving the old one to a safe location as a backup
    - Be sure to review the Configuration Changes section of the release notes
      in docs/release-notes/README-(version) for all versions between your
      original version and the new version. You may need to manually add
      new items to your config.inc.php file.



Upgrading the Harvester database
---------------------------------

After obtaining the latest Harvester code, an additional script must be run to
complete the upgrade process by upgrading the Harvester database and
potentially executing additional upgrade code.

This script can be executed from the command-line or via the Harvester web
interface.

1. Command-line

If you have the CLI version of PHP installed (e.g., /usr/bin/php), you can
upgrade the database by running the following command from the Harvester
directory:

    $ php tools/upgrade.php upgrade


2. Web

If you do not have the PHP CLI installed, you can also upgrade by running a
web-based script. To do so:

    - Edit config.inc.php and change "installed = On" to "installed = Off"
    - Open a web browser to your Harvester site; you should be redirected to
      the installation and upgrade page
    - Select the "Upgrade" link and follow the on-screen instructions
    - Re-edit config.inc.php and change "installed = Off" back to
       "installed = On"
