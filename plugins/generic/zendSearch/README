=== Harvester Zend Search / Lucene & SOLR Plugin

================================

About
-----
This plugin for the PKP Harvester supports Apache's Lucene search engine
technology, either via Zend's "Zend Search" PHP port, which is built into the
PKP codebase, or via the Apache SOLR project, which will require an external
SOLR installation. SOLR/Lucene is the recommended configuration, as it is both
faster and more fully featured, though it has substantial installation
requirements that will not be available e.g. in shared hosting environments.

License
-------
This plugin is licensed under the GNU General Public License v2. See the file
COPYING for the complete terms of this license.

Installation
------------
To install the plugin:
 - as Site Administrator, go into the "System Plugins" page, into the "Generic"
   plugin category, and enable the Zend Framework Search Plugin.
 - Once enabled, find the "Settings" link (again, under "System Plugins" >
   "Generic" > "Zend Framework Search Plugin"); here you can configure the URL
   to the SOLR installation, if one is used. Leave this field blank if the
   built-in "Zend Search" library is to be used.
 - Once enabled, the plugin will add a link called "Search Form" under "Site
   Management". This defines the schema that will be used to index content,
   and the fields that will be available for searching under the Search link.
 - A search form element must be created for each field that the plugin will 
   index; these MUST be entered before any search results will appear.
 - Note that archive metadata indexes must be updated for this to take effect.

Usage
-----
The Lucene schema must match the Search Form configuration. The PKP Harvester
requires the following fields to exist:
 - id (Numeric; this is used to store the record IDs)
 - harvesterArchiveId (Numeric; this is used to store the archive IDs)
 - harvesterIdentifier (String)
 - text (String; this is used to index all textual content)

Additionally, the Search Form allows for the definition of additional fields
that can be indexed and searched. The "symbolic name" field defines the name
of the field in the Lucene search index.
