		<![CDATA[<p>The Zend Search plugin for the PKP Harvester supports Apache's Lucene search engine
		technology, either via Zend's "Zend Search" PHP port, which is built into the
		PKP codebase, or via the Apache SOLR project, which will require an external
		SOLR installation. SOLR/Lucene is the recommended configuration, as it is both
		faster and more fully featured, though it has substantial installation
		requirements that will not be available e.g. in shared hosting environments.</p>
